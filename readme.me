This is the code for the operator support system in the master's thesis
Optimization-based control of cooling plant with dissimilar chillers
by Torleiv Fjalestad

I would recommend installing the requirements in a conda environment by installing anaconda,
running `conda create -n myenv python=3.12`
activate the environment with `conda activate myenv`
install pip with `conda install pip`
and then install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Use `streamlit run main.py` to run the operator support system.
